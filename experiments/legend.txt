Legend:
 - PATTERN    : The pattern, Gaps in skipgrams are represented as {*}. Variable-width gaps in flexgrams are shown using  {**}.
 - COUNT      : The occurrence count - the amount of times the pattern occurs in the data
 - TOKENS     : The maximum number of tokens in the corpus that this pattern covers. *THIS IS JUST A MAXIMUM PROJECTION* rather than an exact number because your model is not indexed
 - COVERAGE   : The maximum number of tokens covered, as a fraction of the total in the corpus (projection)
 - CATEGORY   : The pattern type category (ngram,skipgram,flexgram)
 - SIZE       : The size of the pattern (in tokens)
 - FREQUENCY  : The frequency of the pattern *within it's pattern type category and size-class*.
 - REFERENCES : A space-delimited list of sentence:token position where the pattern occurs in the data. Sentences start at 1, tokens at 0
